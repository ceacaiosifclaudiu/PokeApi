# PokeApi

#This is a test in React

On this test General requirements are:

- As a starting point for your code please use the Create React
  App tool, not other solutions like Next.js or Gatsby
- Data should be fetched from the Poke API
- Usage of flexbox
- Usage of React hooks along with function components instead
  of class based components
- Usage of React Router
- Both pages should have a fixed background image
- The pokemon list page should contain a search input at the top
  that filters the list based on the name of the pokemons. The
  input should have a debounce response time of 300ms from
  when the user stops typing.
- Each pokemon in the list should be a card that contains the
  name and the image (default front sprite)
- There should be 4 cards per row and the distance between
  them should be of 20 pixels
- Clicking on a pokemon card will navigate to a detail page
- The detail page should display the description, all images
  (sprites), the type/types (water for example) and the stats of
  the pokemon (special attack for example)
- The type/types of the pokemon should be displayed as a
  rounded badge (should look like this but without using a UI
  library like Bootstrap)
- The stats of the pokemon should be displayed as an unordered
  list
